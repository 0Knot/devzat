# Devzat

Where are the devs at? Devzat!

Devzat is chat over SSH

Try it out:

```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com
```

Add this to `~/.ssh/config`:
```ssh
Host chat
    HostName devzat.hackclub.com
```

Now you can join with just:
```sh
ssh chat
```

We also have a Slack bridge! If you're on the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) Slack, check out the `#ssh-chat-bridge` channel!
